        My favorite color is <b>red</b> if it wasn't obvious enough by this page color, lol.
        <br>
        Cats are my favorite type of animals, I used to have a cat of my own. His name is Tiger.
        <br>
        Below is a picture of him taking a nap, I also have some videos of him on my TikTok.

        I love to play and script Roblox games, I'm not very good at building however. 
        <br>
        I do enjoy helping people with their troubles on the Roblox Devforum when I'm free, mostly stuff related to programming.
        <br>
        JavaScript, Lua, and HTML w/ css is all the programming languages I know at this time. I enjoy JavaScript the most, but Lua is a close second. (They are pretty similar after all.)
